abstract={Today, modeling and subsequent digital model representations are essential constituents in collaborative endeavors on organizational change. Once created, models need to be digitized for shared stakeholder understanding and further processing. Whenever paper serves as carrier medium, it is likely to disrupt further processing, elicitation, and modeling. While digital environments support transformation processes in collaborative modeling from its very beginning, the necessary technical infrastructure still might hamper situated capturing of models. Hence, this contribution aims to reduce the need for sophisticated technical components by enabling stakeholders to capture their paper-based models in a situation-sensitive way. We present a system that enables capturing paper-based models with mundane technical means by end users under uncontrolled conditions. We describe the components developed for recognition of these models and embed it in a mixed-modality workflow supported by a tabletop interfacing a web platform for further processing. As our empirical evidence demonstrates, this approach enables both situated and error-tolerant capturing of hand-drawn conceptual models by individual users. Moreover, it can be integrated with more sophisticated IT-based modeling tools for further digital processing.},

abstract="The Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN) is an increasingly important industry standard for the graphical representation of business processes. BPMN offers a wide range of modeling constructs, significantly more than other popular languages. However, not all of these constructs are equally important in practice as business analysts frequently use arbitrary subsets of BPMN. In this paper we investigate what these subsets are, and how they differ between academic, consulting, and general use of the language. We analyzed 120 BPMN diagrams using mathematical and statistical techniques. Our findings indicate that BPMN is used in groups of several, well-defined construct clusters, but less than 20{\%} of its vocabulary is regularly used and some constructs did not occur in any of the models we analyzed. While the average model contains just 9 different BPMN constructs, models of this complexity have typically just 4-5 constructs in common, which means that only a small agreed subset of BPMN has emerged. Our findings have implications for the entire ecosystems of analysts and modelers in that they provide guidance on how to reduce language complexity, which should increase the ease and speed of process modeling.",

abstract = "Business process modeling is heavily applied in practice, but important quality issues have not been addressed thoroughly by research. A notorious problem is the low level of modeling competence that many casual modelers in process documentation projects have. Existing approaches towards model quality might be of benefit, but they suffer from at least one of the following problems. On the one hand, frameworks like SEQUAL and the Guidelines of Modeling are too abstract to be applicable for novices and non-experts in practice. On the other hand, there are collections of pragmatic hints that lack a sound research foundation. In this paper, we analyze existing research on relationships between model structure on the one hand and error probability and understanding on the other hand. As a synthesis we propose a set of seven process modeling guidelines (7PMG). Each of these guidelines builds on strong empirical insights, yet they are formulated to be intuitive to practitioners. Furthermore, we analyze how the guidelines are prioritized by industry experts. In this regard, the seven guidelines have the potential to serve as an important tool of knowledge transfer from academia into modeling practice."
